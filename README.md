🖼️1. AI Image Classifier with Gradio + PyTorch 🚀
````markdown
This is a simple AI-powered **Image Classifier** built using **Gradio** and **PyTorch's ResNet18 model**.  
It allows you to upload any image and get **instant predictions** of what's in the image—right from your browser!

🌟 Features
✅ Upload any image (lion, car, cat, etc.)  
✅ AI predicts the top 3 most likely objects in the image  
✅ Fast, simple, and interactive web interface using **Gradio**  
✅ Powered by **PyTorch** and the **ResNet18** model trained on ImageNet  

🚀 Quick Demo (How It Works)

1. The user uploads an image 📸
2. The AI model (ResNet18) analyzes the image 🧠
3. Gradio displays the top 3 predictions along with confidence levels 📊
