# 🖼️ AI Image Classifier using Gradio + PyTorch 🚀

This is a beginner-friendly **AI-powered Image Classifier** built entirely in **Jupyter Notebook** using **Gradio** and **PyTorch's ResNet18 model**.  
The application allows users to upload an image and get instant predictions of what's inside the image—right from the browser!

## 🌟 Why I Built This

As someone starting my journey into **AI and machine learning**, I wanted to create a **hands-on, practical project** that not only helped me learn but could also be shared with others.  
This project proves that **with just a few lines of code, anyone can build interactive AI applications** without deep knowledge of web development.

---

## 🔗 Live Demo

> 📝 Since this project was built and tested in **Jupyter Notebook**, you can easily download the notebook, install the requirements, and run it locally.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload any image (animals, objects, etc.)  
✅ AI predicts the **top 3 most likely classes**  
✅ Fast, interactive, and beginner-friendly web interface using **Gradio**  
✅ Powered by **PyTorch** and pre-trained **ResNet18** on ImageNet

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **PyTorch**
- **Gradio**
- **PIL (Pillow)**
- **Pre-trained ResNet18 Model**

## 📦 How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/gradio-image-classifier.git
cd gradio-image-classifier
````

### 2. Install Required Libraries:

```bash
pip install gradio torch torchvision pillow requests
```

### 3. Launch the Notebook:

Open `gradio_image_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and **run all cells**.

✅ Once you run the final cell, Gradio will launch an interactive web app at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```
